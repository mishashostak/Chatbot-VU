# Project: Unibot VU Amsterdam X_400475

In this project, you will create a program that mimics the workings of a university chatbot designed to help first-year students access important information. You will design an algorithm and present it as a flowchart and pseudocode. Furthermore, you will report on the design process and write about the broader implications of such algorithms in the project report.

The system you will implement is called Unibot, which is a chatbot feature integrated into the website of a university. Its purpose is to help new students find important information about student life and make the most of their time at the university. In essence, Unibot asks what topic the student wants to find out more about, then presents some follow-up questions to provide the student with the most relevant information.

Naturally, Unibot will be a much simpler algorithm than real-life chatbots, which use generative language models. In your case, the algorithmâ€™s purpose will be to navigate topics based on relatively simple rules specified in the next section.
